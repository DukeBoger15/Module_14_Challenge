<h1>Module_14_Challenge</h1>
<li>This repo contains the code for my FinTech Bootcamp Module 14 Challenge</li>
<h2>Background</h2>
<li>We are assuming the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Our firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, the firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders. The speed at which these transactions occur give our firm a competitive advantage early on. But people still need to specifically program these systems, which creates limits in their ability to adapt to new data. Thus we are planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm's competitive advantage in the market. To accomplish this, we will enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.</li>
<h3>What We Are Creating</h3>
<li>We are combining our new algorithmic trading skills with our existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets. In our Jupyter notebook, we will do the following:</li>
<li>1). Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.</li>
<li>2). Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.</li>
<li>3). Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.</li>
<h4>Libraries and Programs Used</h4>
<li>Pandas, numpy, hvplot, matplotlib, scikit-learn, StandardScaler, DateOffset, & classification_report</li>
